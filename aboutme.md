### my history

Now, this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down.
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air.

In west Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool, and all shootin some b-ball outside of the school. When a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'.

I begged and pleaded with her day after day but she packed my suit case and sent me on my way. She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.

First class, yo, this is bad. Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmm this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that. Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so. I'll see when I get there, I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out there was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out. I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here, I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared.

I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'.

I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth nd I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'. I looked at my kingdom; I was finally there to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.
